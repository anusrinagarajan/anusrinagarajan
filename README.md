# 👋 Hi, I'm Anusri!

Hi there! 

I'm Anusri, a second-year Data Science student at San Jose State University!

Currently, I'm growing my interpersonal and technical skills as an Adversarial AI researcher at SJSU MICoSys Lab, a Technical Chair for SJSU Society of Women Engineers, and an AI/ML Fellow at Salesforce in collaboration with Break Through Tech AI. I've previously explored industry as an AI/ML Intern at Google Cloud, an IBM extern, a consultant for Praxis AI, and by pursuing projects that bring together curiosity, problem-solving, and real-world impact.

My dream? To make an impact. A big one. And that starts with empowering others, sharing knowledge, and building solutions that matter.
